              I've been exploring the world of software development for less
              than a year. While I'm still relatively new, I'm passionate and
              eager to learn. My journey into coding started after pursuing
              education in various other fields, but I found my true excitement
              in software.

              I'm especially drawn to frontend development because it combines
              my love for design with the creativity of building interactive
              user experiences. Design has always been a personal interest, so
              working on the frontend really excites meâ€”it feels like the
              perfect way to blend logic and aesthetics.
            </p>

              I'm constantly pushing myself to improve and grow, and I'm ready
              to tackle new challenges in the tech world.
